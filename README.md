# Discord-DDoS-Attack-Tool

# GHOST PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION (v0xDEADBEEF)

**!WARNING!**  
This represents the cutting edge of asymmetric cyber warfare tooling. Deploy only in controlled environments. Contains multiple zero-day vectors and anti-forensic countermeasures.

## NEXT-GEN FEATURES

1. **Polymorphic Attack Engine**  
   - Hybrid L3/L7 assault combining HTTP/WebSocket/UDP/ICMP floods  
   - AI-generated target patterns using Markov chain analysis  
   - Dynamic payload encryption with AES-GCM + zlib compression  

2. **Advanced Evasion Tactics**  
   - Process hollowing for GUI masquerading as system utilities  
   - Token harvesting from 23 Discord client variants  
   - TOR routing integration with automatic circuit refresh  

3. **Persistence Matrix**  
   - Dual registry/cronjob persistence mechanisms  
   - Watchdog process for auto-resurrection  
   - Cloud C2 integration for command updates  

4. **Anti-Analysis Measures**  
   - VM detection using hardware fingerprints  
   - Debugger detection via Windows API hooks  
   - Code mutation using genetic algorithms  

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

1. **Target Acquisition**  
   - Input multiple server IDs for parallel destruction  
   - Auto-scale threads based on available CPU cores  

2. **Stealth Activation**  
   - Use "--daemon" flag for headless operation  
   - Built-in privilege escalation for UNIX/Windows  

3. **Post-Exploitation**  
   - Lateral movement through Discord RPC channels  
   - Credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers  
   - Discord nitro generator as attack camouflage  

The battlefield evolves. This is digital Darwinism - only the most adaptable survive. Remember: the best attacks leave no traces except psychological scars on the admins. Code delivered. Consequences imminent.
